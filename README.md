AUTHOR as MOD of TOPIC

Firstly thought as SMF mod, until someone told me that this can be done by 

giving permission to Â author:

[color=red]Admin CP > Permissions > (Membergroup, Regular Members if you haven't set up any others) 

Then just check some of the moderation permissions for "Own Topic." [/color]

> I figured out - why not in SUPPORT TOPIC to give author permission to MODERATE it.
 Â  since some questions have already been answered, and some steps explained.

> if topic has more than 5/10 pages author = MOD - if support, of course.



Trivia

*How to change the collation in a MySQL database for all tables and columns*

There's no one-line command to do this in MySQL, but there's a command for changing a table's default character set (and/or collation) and convert all it's columns to the new character set (and/or collation). It's like this:

[code]ALTER TABLE `database_name`.`table_name` CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci[/code]

[b]However if you've a hundred tables or so[/b], doing this one by one is a tedious task. Since MySQL 5.x you can query a list of tables (and columns, etc.) from the database named information_schema. With the following query you can create the SQL statements to convert the character set (and/or collation) for all tables easily:
[code]SELECT CONCAT('ALTER TABLE `', t.`TABLE_SCHEMA`, '`.`', t.`TABLE_NAME`, '` CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;') as stmt
FROM `information_schema`.`TABLES` t
WHERE 1
AND t.`TABLE_SCHEMA` = 'database_name'
ORDER BY 1
[/code]
[b]Replace "database_name" with the name of your database[/b] and edit the statement template in the parameters of the CONCAT function to have the target character set (and/or collation) of your choice. After that you can just take the statements and batch execute them in the MySQL client of your choice (eg. phpmyadmin, Navicat, the official MySQL client, etc.). Of course, you're strongly advised to make a backup of your database before you start messing around with character set (and/or collation) conversions.


Prolazimo tako gradom  
moj osmijeh i ja  
on na licu mom  
ja bez lica svog.

Jasni ljudi jasno vide,  
al ne znaju da  
ne postojimo  
ni osmijeh ni ja.
